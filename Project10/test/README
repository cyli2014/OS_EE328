This project requires implementing the FileSystem.java
interface. We have provided the class JavaFileSystem.java
which implements this interface, although all methods
currently throw a RuntimeException. Your task is to 
remove the RuntimeException and add the logic to each method.

Your implementation may be tested using the TestFS.java
class. This class may be invoked by entering the name of one
of the test scripts in the tests directory. For example, to 
test the script test1.data, you would enter

java TestFS ./tests/test1.data

Furthermore, you may use just a command line interface
in TestFS.java to test specific methods. If you were to enter:

	java TestFS

you are presented with the following prompt:

	-->

where you may enter one of the commands that are specified in
the test scripts. For example, to format the disk, you would enter:

	--> formatDisk 10 2

To create a file, you would enter

	--> file = create

To get the inumber of a file, enter:

	--> inum = inumber file

Scan through the test scripts to see how to enter the command specific
to each method in the FileSystem interface.

/* This is a basic test file for the file system program.  It tests all
/*  the basic commands as well as single indirection.

formatDisk 100 10

//CREATE FIRST file, write 10000 bytes
file1 = create
inum1 = inumber file1
write file1 HiThere 10000

//CREATE SECOND file, seek 1000 bytes, write 1000 bytes
file2 = create
inum2 = inumber file2
seek file2 1000 0
write file2 Yo 1000

//READ 50 bytes from FIRST file at offset 9990
seek file1 -10 1
read file1 50

//READ 50 bytes from SECOND file at offset 990
seek file2 -1010 2
read file2 50

//CLOSE FIRST file
inumber file1
close file1

//CREATE THIRD file, write 1000 bytes, seek 10, write 1000 bytes
file3 = create
write file3 Foo 1000
seek file3 10 1
write file3 Bar 1000

//READ 30 bytes from THIRD file at offset 990
seek file3 990 0
read file3 30

//OPEN FIRST file back into the system
file1 = open inum1

//READ 50 bytes from front of the FIRST file
read file1 50

//CLOSE SECOND file
inumber file2
close file2

//CLEAR SECOND file with inum = 2
delete inum2

//OPEN SECOND file (should give an error)
open inum2

//SHUTDOWN the system
shutdown

//QUIT the simulation
quit
